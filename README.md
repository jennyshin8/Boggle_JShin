## Rules

&#8226; The player gets point only for words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; visible on the tray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; listed in the dictionary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; not capitalized or foreign words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; at least three-letter long<br>
&#8226; There is no penalty for rejected words.<br>
&#8226; Distinct words can use the same dice in the tray, e.g., “home,” “homes,” and “homed” might all appear in the tray.<br>
&#8226; Traversing is not allowed. It means one character can't be used several times to complete a word.
